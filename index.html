    <center><h1>What makes a great skateboard?</h1>
        <br>
<p> Skateboard technology has advanced rapidly since the sport's inception in the early 1950s. Skateboard "decks" are the wooden boards on which the rider stands. The rider attaches "trucks" to their deck, allowing the board to pivot, followed by wheels and bearings that allow the skateboard to roll. Skateboard decks used to be formed of a single solid and flat wood board, but they are now an engineered wood product that is pressed into shape and held together with adhesive.</p>
